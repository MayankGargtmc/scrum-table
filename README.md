# scrum-table

This is the online solution to the type of srum table that students make for themselves to efficiently and accurately complete their various processes on time.

I have made it using php language and in vscode editor .. so unlike netbeans, i used XAMPP('multiplateform' , 'apache server' , 'MariaDB' , 'Perl' , 'php') for connecting my 
php files to database and hosting the website on localhost.

One can create a new story in the starting .. then u can see a edit button infornt of each story as well as a delete button which deletes the whole story.
Edit button will enable you to add, update, edit any task on any of the vertical( not started, processing, done) 

i could not find the way to take multiple task under same id(i.e. the same story), so one can write multiple task himself under any of vertical seperated by a comma or semicolon
as per your convinience.

Hope you shall have great time using it!

Thank you!!
