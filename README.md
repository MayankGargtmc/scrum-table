# scrum-table

This is the online solution(single page web application) to the type of srum table that students make for themselves to efficiently and accurately complete their various processes on time, implimmenting the CRUD operations using the database(mysql(MariaDB here))

I have made it using php language and in vscode editor .. so unlike netbeans, i used XAMPP('multiplateform' , 'apache server' , 'MariaDB' , 'Perl' , 'php') for connecting my 
php files to database and hosting the website on localhost. Also got help from brilliant bootstrap classes.

One can create a new story in the starting .. then u can see a edit button infornt of each story as well as a delete button which deletes the whole story.
Edit button will enable you to add, update, edit any task on any of the vertical( not started, processing, done) 

i could not find the way to take multiple task under same id(i.e. the same story), so one can write multiple task himself under any of vertical seperated by a comma or semicolon
as per your convinience.

Hope you shall have great time using it!

Thank you!!
